# Application authorization

It is to authorize the applications to access assets data which are created or purchased of the organization.

## Asset authorization

1. Click **Asset authorization**, then tick the asset tree node on the left, or directly select a site in the asset list on the right.

2. Click **Authorize** and the application can access data for all selected sites.

## Note

1. The asset tree on the left include the root node and all child nodes. Tick the check box before a child node, and all sites subordinate to the node will be selected.
2. The right side shows the information of all sites under the currently selected node and the path of the site location.
3. Once the “All Assets” option is checked, any new site accessed will be authorized for the current application by default.
